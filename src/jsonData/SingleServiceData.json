Because we operate our own, we know the minute details of what it takes to get the job done. In a developing country like Bangladesh, where infrastructure can leave you a lot to desire for, transportation of Heavy Lift Cargo can be a challenging prospect and poses a greater threat in completion of the job compared to a developed country with sound infrastructure. Choosing the right people with sound local know how and vast working experience is one of the most important factors to your success and this is where SARKAR GROUP plays a crucial role and works as your key partner for the successful completion of your project."
